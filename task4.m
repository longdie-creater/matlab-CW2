% Reflective Statement:

% Challenges:
% The connection and using of github is a little bit confusing.
% The circuit sometimes didn't work for no reason, I have to restart matlab.
% Each test need 10 min, this is quite a ling time

% Strengths:
% 1.The system has real-time feedback capability, allowing LEDs to indicate 
% the trend of temperature changes, providing immediate visual feedback and
% enhancing the user experience.

% 2.The real-time temperature graph update feature also allows users to
% visually track how temperature changes over time.

% Limitations:
% 1.The temperature prediction only considers a linear model of temperature
% change rate, which may not account for nonlinear changes in 
% real-world applications. To improve prediction accuracy, more 
% advanced models could be introduced.
% 2.The data collection frequency is set to one reading per second,
% which might not provide enough precision for certain use cases. 
% Increasing the sampling rate could improve data accuracy.

% Future Improvements:
% 1. Use more advanced prediction models to improve the accuracy.
% 2. Optimize data storage by periodically writing log files.
